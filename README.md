# Coterie Take Home


## Technologies Used

Application is built on the following:

### Front End

Language: TypeScript
Framework: Functional React/Redux

Also includes Material UI for styling, Google Maps APIs, and React Router DOM.

### Back End

Language: JavaScript
Framework: Node.JS/Express
Testing: Jest
DB: MongoDB

## Installation

This is the front-end portion of ParPo. You can clone this repo to your desktop and run it with:

```
npm install
npm start
```

There may be additional authentication required by Firebase. Please reach out to zach@propterra.io if you have issues.

##  Current Works-in-Progress

The current version of this project is the publicly visible demo for ParPo. In future iterations, we are planning to:

    -   Fully containerize app to deploy on K8s
    -   Improved error handling for edge cases to allow easier scaling of functionality later
    -   Finish updating profile section to separate user lists by company
    -   Add company specific log in to have defined different views by logged in organizations.

##  How to Use This Project

To have partial admin access, login with "admin@gmail.com", "password" to have the full view. In this repo, some functionality has been stripped away for data integrity purposes. Otherwise, log in with your Google account to access the project as a normal viewer. Peruse through the various properties to help you decide whether to invest with this hypothetical firm!

##  External Integrations

ParPo leverages Firebase, Firestore, MongoDB and GCP Cloud Functions to handle most of the backend and data storage. As such, some access may be limited if running from a local machine without authentication. If this is the case, please reach out to zach@propterra.io to discuss project access.
